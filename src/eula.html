            <h2>End-User License Agreement (EULA) of Deskypus</h2>

            <p>This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and Deskypus</p>

            <p>
                This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of our Deskypus software ("Software") directly from
                Deskypus or indirectly through a Deskypus authorized reseller or distributor (a "Reseller").
            </p>

            <p>
                Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the installation process and using the
                Deskypus software. It provides a license to use the Deskypus software and contains warranty information
                and liability disclaimers.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you register for a free trial of the Deskypus software, this EULA agreement will also govern that
                trial. By clicking "accept" or installing and/or using the Deskypus software, you are confirming your
                acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent
                that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you
                do not have such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement,
                do not install or use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
                This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by Deskypus herewith regardless of whether
                other software is referred to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Deskypus updates,
                supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for the Software, unless other terms
                accompany those items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.
            </p>

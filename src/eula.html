            <p>
                This End-User License Agreement (EULA) is a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or on
                behalf of an entity) and Praneet Loke regarding your use of Deskypus&#39;s desktop applications, and
                associated documentation (the &quot;Software&quot;). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS
                EULA, DO NOT INSTALL, USE OR COPY THE SOFTWARE.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>You must agree to all of the terms of this EULA to use this Software.</li>
                <li>If so, you may use the Software for free and for any lawful purpose.</li>
                <li>
                    This Software automatically communicates with its server for three reasons: (1) to receive and
                    install updates; (2) to send error reports; and (3) to send anonymized usage information. You can
                    view sample data to see what information is sent, and you may opt out of sending the anonymized
                    usage data.
                </li>
                <li>

                    not liable for anything you do with it.

                    You really ought to just go ahead and read the whole EULA. It&#39;s not all that long. You should
                    not only rely on this summary.
